What makes VIAVI avocado’s different? ● Longevity after slicing ● Smaller seed ● Bigger fruit ● More food About Viavi: Born and bred in the fruitful valleys of Venda, Limpopo, Viavi is the first and only truly South African avocado to date. Viavi is selected by hand for perfect maturity and optimum quality only once the fruit has been ripened. The word Viavi is deducted from the Tshivenda word for a Chameleon, Lua’Viavi, as the skin of the fruit transitions from green to purple-black as it matures in the ripening process. The Saturday Star
