Staff Reporter Bystanders watched in horror as a severe storm with heavy rains and gusty winds saw the roof of the Global Garage in Sharpville, Vereeniging collapse onto a taxi, a bus and a car on Friday afternoon. ER 24 spokesperson Russel Meiring explained that just after 2pm, two men were lucky to escape serious injury when the roof collapsed onto the three vehicles.

There were also reports that the Midvaal Hospital in Three Rivers had flooded and various roads in the area was underwater. Meanwhile, several parts of Pretoria were also hard hit by the afternoon thunderstorms. Footage posted on various social media platforms showed several roads in the northern part of Gauteng flooded during peak-time traffic. Annlin, in the north of Pretoria, was particularly hard-hit with images on Twitter showing poor road visibility and vehicles struggling to drive through the water on the streets. There were also several reports of rainfall in several other parts of the province. The SAWS warned that a significant amount of rainfall is expected over the weekend in the provinces with temperatures also expected to drop into the mid teens to low twenties. Flood prone areas in Gauteng over the years include Alex, Bedfordview, Benoni, Centurion, Edenvale and Fourways,  Johannesburg central, Kempton Park and Soweto.
