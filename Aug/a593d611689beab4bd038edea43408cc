*Brad Van Zyl turned to selling alcohol as a way to make making ends meet. “I think most people have been forced into a side hustle like selling alcohol and cigarettes.” Van Zyl operates from his home in a suburb in Johannesburg. And business has been good. “It’s kind of created a passive income over these trying times. “What we have realised is that people would pay nearly anything to get their hands on something. Since the ban was lifted and then reinstated we see that people are a lot more careful when spending their money.” Van Zyl’s prices vary as he buys his alcohol from a number of suppliers. “During the lockdown, prices on alcohol have varied from source to source, some leaving meat on the bone for resale and some taking full advantage of the situation. “Prices differ in quantity but can also be negotiated down but nothing more than R30 to R50. When the supply is low, the prices shoot up. I have heard of some people getting stock from bottle stores, but the risk is high having to move large quantities in such a short space of time.” While the prices of alcohol may have doubled and sometimes almost tripled during the ban, Van Zyl believes the prices are not nearly as inflated as those selling cigarettes. “Alcohol prices have sky-rocketed; but cigarettes have been the main money maker. The prices are crazy at the moment.” He believes the ban on alcohol has done more harm than good. “There has been no offer of addiction support or any support whatsoever, and no real explanation. I’m sure the intentions were good in the beginning but all the black market trading has defeated the whole object of what is supposed to be happening. “This has turned innocent, hard working people into criminals and ripped away the rights of people.” Van Zyl said. * Not his real name The Saturday Star
